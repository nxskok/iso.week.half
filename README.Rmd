The goal of iso.week.half is to obtain a week number for a date, with an additional 0.5 for a date on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.

## Installation

From Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nxskok/iso.week.half")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(iso.week.half)
iso_week_half(as.Date("2020-07-03"))
iso_week_half(as.Date("2020-07-02"))
```

in 2020, July 2 was in a different half-week because it was on a Thursday.
